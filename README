BuddyPress with REST Access
---------------------------
 
This application is based on a clone of wordpress (/src/wordpress), within wordpress there is a submodule of BuddyPress (src/wordpress/wp-content/plugins/buddypress) and there is also a submodule of the REST library restler (src/api/lib/restler) 

there is two parts to this application 

1. the main frontend wordpress/buddypress application (setup as www.buddyrest.com) 
2. the REST API which includes wp-config from wordpress (setup as api.buddyrest.com)

# Installing the application 
1) clone the BuddyRest repo
git clone git@github.com:phpchap/BuddyRest.git

2) setup the submodules
cd BuddyRest # change into project root
chmod u+x update_submodules.sh # make the update submodules shell script executable 
./update_submodules.sh # run the update submodules shell script

3) run the unit tests to make sure everythings cool
phpunit .

4) configure your apache vhosts
(ive included my vhost in APACHE_VHOST)

5) setup the wordpress application (you will have to delete and add 'wp-config.php' to .gitignore) or setup your application using my config..


thats it!
